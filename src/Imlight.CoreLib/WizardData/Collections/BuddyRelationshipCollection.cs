 * ========================================================================
 * BUDDY RELATIONSHIP COLLECTION.
 * ========================================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Manages database operations for buddy relationships between players.
 * 
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 * var relationship = new Relationship {
 *     FirstPlayerId = 123456789,
 *     SecondPlayerId = 987654321,
 *     IsBrokenUp = false
 * };
 * BuddyRelationshipCollection.AddRelationship(relationship);
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Flow to adding a friend:
    1. Player A clicks on player B's character and selects "Add Friend".
        Player A sends GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD to the server. Player A keeps track of player B's ID.
    2. Server forwards the request to player B with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADDFWD.
    3. Player B receives the request, and adds it to their pending friend requests. They will see a notification in the client.
    4. Player B can now accept or deny the request.
        a. If they accept, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT to the server.
        b. If they deny, they send GAME_5_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY to the server.
    5. Server forwards the response to player A with CHARACTER_103_PROTOCOL.MSG_BUDDYREQUESTREPLYFWD. If the sender
         is offline, we will have to go to the database directly to add the friend.
    6. Player A receives the response. If the response is an acceptance, they will add the friend to their list.
        Player A's game client will see a notification that the friend request has been accepted.
