 * INTERACT QUEST SELECT COMPONENT
 * ========================================================================
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Handles a quest goal where the player's goal is to interact with a
 * specific object in the game world.
 *
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Collection goals (tally count > 1) consume the object on use; single-use goals
 * leave the object in place and drive post-use state via completeResults.
